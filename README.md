# Garry's Mod 10 Scoreboard for Garry's Mod 13
This is pretty much a direct port of the gmod 10 scoreboard over to 13, ratings and everything work with an an added DarkRP version.

Installation (for servers):
If you're on DarkRP then make sure to put "gmod10_scoreboard_darkrp" in your addons folder ONLY. If you're not on DarkRP then only put the base "gmod10_scoreboard" in your addons folder. Simply restart your server afterwards and you're good to go.

This addon has small issues with singleplayer and I don't plan on fixing them because wanting a custom scoreboard in singleplayer is redundant. Maybe if the gmod singleplayer scoreboard enthusiasts community bothers me about it enough I'll look into it.
