# Garry's Mod 10 Scoreboard for Garry's Mod 13
This is pretty much a direct port of the gmod 10 scoreboard over to 13, ratings and everything work.

Installation (for servers):
Download the repository and extract the it from the .zip, then place the extracted "gmod10_scoreboard" folder into your server's addons.

This addon has small issues with singleplayer and I don't plan on fixing them because wanting a custom scoreboard in singleplayer is redundant. Maybe if the gmod singleplayer scoreboard enthusiasts community bothers me about it enough I'll look into it.
